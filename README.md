This is the code and data for a cricket interactive to be published on [wionews.com](http://www.wionews.com).

This interactive visualises the history of India-Pakistan one-day matches.

Used a modified version of Adam Pearce's [Graph-Scroll.js library](1wheel.github.io/graph-scroll/) to make this interactive. 

Apart from the Graph-Scroll.js library, I also used Gregor Aisch's [d3 jetpack](https://github.com/gka/d3-jetpack) and the [d3-geo microlibrary](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo).

Based a lot of my code on this [bl.ocks.org example](https://bl.ocks.org/SpaceActuary/d6b5ca8e5fb17842d652d0de21e88a05) done by SpaceActuary. Lots of other examples from stackoverflow.com used too, have mentioned their urls where possible in [index.html](index.html).

Used data from [Cricinfo.com](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/pakvind/engine/records/team/match_results.html?class=2;id=6;id=7;type=headtohead).
